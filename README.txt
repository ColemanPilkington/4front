** Bird's Eye View **
4front is a tasklist that allows a user to easily view current working goals.
Based on the "todo, working, complete" boards in computer programming
offices/classrooms (or in your head, if you don't have a visual tracker)
Keeps tasks on the 4front of your mind.

** Mission Statement **
I created 4front to be a free, open source task checklist system. Many programmers,
including myself, greatly benefit from a visual aid to keep track of their progress.
Organization and productivity does not need paywalls.
If this application helps just one person stay on track and accomplish their goals,
I am happy.
